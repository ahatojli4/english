Use the future continuous (`will be+verb-ing`) to say that an action will (already) be in progress at a
certain time in the future.

> A. We'll have dinner at 8.00 (=we will start dinner at 8.00)
> B. We'll be having dinner at 8.00 (=at 8.00 we will already have started having dinner)

Also, we sometimes use the future continuous, like the present continuous, to talk about things which are already planned or decided.

> - Brett, can you help me move to a new apartment on Friday at 11.00.
> - Sorry, I can't, I'll be teaching Friday at 11.00.

> - Dan, we should catch up in person this summer.
> - I'm not sure, I'll be able to, because I'll be living in Rome this summer.

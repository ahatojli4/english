`will + present perfect`

We use it to say that something will be finished by a certain point in the future.

Example (future simple):
> I will finish this cup of chicory root at 21:00
> (Exactly at 21:00, the cup will be finished - that's when I will take my last sip (глоток))

Example (future perfect):
> I will have finished this cup of chicory root by 21:00.
> This means that before 21:00, it will be finished - we don't know when exactly, but at some point between now and 21:00.

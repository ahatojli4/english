## Past Continuous

We use the past continuous (was/ were+ verb + verb-ing) to describe a longer continuous past action or situation which was in progress when another action happened (1), or to describe an action or situation that was in progress at a past time (2).

1. I was listening to music when my neighbor knocked on the door.
2. Yesterday at 2.00 pm, Winnie the Pooh was taking a nap.

## Past Perfect Continuous

We use the past perfect continuous (had been+ verb + verb-ing) with action verbs to talk about longer continuous actions or situations that started before the main events happened and have continued up to that point. Non-action verbs (e.g. be, have, know, like, etc.) are not normally used in the past continuous or past perfect continuous.

1. Yesterday Winnie the Pooh had been eating honey for two hours when he decided to take a nap.

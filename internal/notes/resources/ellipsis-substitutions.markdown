In short, `ellipsis` is when we omit certain words and `substitution` is when we replace a word (or several words) with another word (or other words).

`Ellipsis` and `substitution` help to make language sound more natural and less mechanical.

## Ellipsis

In informal speech, it's quite common for L1 users to omit the beginnings some phrases. This is used when the words that we are omitting are clearly obvious to the listener.

Examples:
- 'be' in imperatives: Careful! (instead of: be careful)
- pronouns: Don't know. (instead of: I don't know)
- pronouns + be + articles: Nice haircut! (instead of: It's a nice haircut)
- auxiliary verbs + pronouns: Coming out later? Done anything interesting recently? (Are you...? Have you...?)

Words are often left out after an auxiliary verb to avoid repetition:

> I like chocolate, but my sister doesn't.
> You've been to the Hermitage, but I haven't.

If a verb is followed by an infinitive, we keep the 'to' but omit the verb:

> You don't have to do your homework if you don't want to.
> I asked him to close the window, but he refused to.


Examples:

- 
	> You need to tidy your room.
	> I already have tidied my room
	
	> Tidy your room.
	> Already have!
- 
	> Here you are, sir, two bottles of water.
	> No, we only ordered one bottle of water.
- 
	> It's raining hard outside.
	> Yeah, it's a good thing I brought an umbrella.
- 
	> It was lovely to see Sally again, wasn't it?
	> Yeah, it's a pity she couldn't stay longer.
- 
	> Have you sent Judy the templates yet?
	> No, I'm just going to send Judy the templates.
- 
	> Excuse me, is Briggs street near here?
	> I have no idea, I'm sorry.
- 
	> Could you give me a lift?
	> I'm sorry, I don't drive.
- 
	> How many times have I told you not to leave the back door open?
	> I didn't leave the back door open, it was Shelly.


## Substitution

We often use 'one' to substitute a single countable noun to avoid repetition.

> My wife wants to get a dog, but I don't want one!

We can use 'ones' in the same way for plural nouns.

> I love green grapes, but I hate the red ones.

Use 'some' in the same way for uncountable nouns.

> The coffee here is delicious. Do you want some?

We can use 'do'/'does' to substitute a verb:

> A: I don't like Better Call Saul!
> B: Really? I do.
> 
> A doesn't like Better Call Saul, but B does.

We often use 'so' to substitute a clause:

> A: Is it going to rain tomorrow?
> B: I think so.

We use 'so + aux+ subj' or 'neither/nor + aux + subj' in responses to show that two things are the same

> A: I've been to Portugal three times.
> B: So have I.
> 
> A: My favourite season is winter.
> B: So is mine!
> 
> A: I will do my homework!
> B: So will I!
> 
> A: I don't have an iPhone.
> B: Neither do I.
> 
> A: I couldn't see it.
> B: Nor could I.
> 
> A: My computer doesn't work.
> B: Neither does mine.

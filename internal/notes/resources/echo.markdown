.# title:Echo questions. Responding with interest
.# date_create: 2021-05-02

Echo questions are a good way of showing interest. They are natural and the fact that we
must choose the correct auxiliary verb shows that we are at least paying a LITTLE
attention to what the other person is saying.

It's formed simply with an auxiliary verb and a subject.

> - I like football.
> - Do you?

Of course, an echo question in itself isn't enough to maintain the conversation and is only a starting point. After our echo question, we must add something more.

> - I like football.
> - Do you? Do you like playing it or watching it?

> - I went to the shop yesterday.
> - Did you? What did you buy, just food or something else?

> - My sister is an accountant.
> - Is she? that sounds like a pretty stressful job.

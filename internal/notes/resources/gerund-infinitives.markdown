## Adjectives

### Generally, if a verb follows an adjective, it takes the infinitive form

It's nice to meet you.
I would be happy to help you.
She's too tired to do anything this evening.

### Some exceptions:

The adjectives `worth` and `busy` are followed by a gerund:

It's worth watching that film (but: it's worth IT to watch that film).
He's busy having a shower right now.

## Adj + inf or Adj + prep +gerund ?

1. I'm anxious to meet her. (excited - positive)
2. I'm anxious about meeting her. (worried - negative)

1. It's good to swim.
2. I'm good at swimming.

1. I'm sorry to interrupt you. (polite - warning)
2. I'm sorry for interrupting you. (apology)

**anxious to + verb**
**anxious about + noun/verb-ing**

## Nouns

Some nouns are followed by the infinitive (generally, these are nouns whose verb form also takes the infinitive)

I'm planning to do sth
I have plans to do sth

I want to do sth
I have a desire to do sth

I promise to do sth
I made a promise to do sth

But: I don't intend to do sth / I have no intention of doing sth.
I hope to do sth / I have hopes of doing sth

## Noun + gerund

Some nouns are followed by gerunds:

I had no problem finding the hotel.
I had difficulties doing my homework.

A more common pattern is noun + preposition + gerund

She gets a lot of enjoyment out of scrolling Facebook
He has dreams of becoming a rockstar.
She faced an accusation of assaulting a passenger.

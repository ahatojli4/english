## Simple tag questions

In business meetings it's helpful to ask final checking questions at the end, just to make
sure you've understood. The most common way to do this is by making a statement and
then adding "right?" at the end of the statement. You can also use "and", "next" and "also"
at the beginning to indicate you're moving to the next point.

Examples:
- <mark>So</mark>, the contract needs to be signed by both parties, <mark>right</mark>?
- <mark>And</mark>, you'll need a paper copy and a digital copy, <mark>right</mark>?

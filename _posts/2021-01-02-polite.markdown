title: Polite questions

- Excuse me, can you tell me...
- Could you help me...
- Would you mind...
- Do you have any idea...
- I'm not really sure...
- I was wondering...
- Please tell me...
- You don't happen to know...
- You don't by chance know...


## Indirect questions

We can simply repeat the question word (why, what, how, etc.) after the introductory phrase, but the subject (`the television`) and `is` change places.  

> American, can you tell me why <mark>~~**is**~~ the television **is**</mark> always on?

Or, the subject and auxiliary (do, did, has, have, is, etc.) change places.  
So, after the question word, the structure of the sentence becomes like a regular positive sentence.
